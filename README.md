# Unit Roller Series

## Overview

### SKU: U182  U182-Lite

**Roller485 Unit** is an integrated brushless DC motor motion control kit designed for efficient motion control. It supports 6-16V DC power input (via PWR485 interface) or 5V input (via Grove interface) and can automatically adjust power coefficients to ensure optimal performance. It features a built-in **FOC** closed-loop drive system, utilizing a 3504 200KV brushless motor. Without forced cooling, it can operate with a maximum continuous phase current of 0.5A and a short-term current of 1A. The driver uses a magnetic encoder for feedback and supports current, speed, and position control, ensuring precise control.
Additionally, the device is equipped with a 0.66-inch **OLED** display on the back to display the device's status in real-time. It also includes an RGB indicator light and function button for easy human-computer interaction. The product's base is designed with LEGO-compatible mounting holes and M3 screw holes, making it easy to assemble and integrate. Roller485 Unit’s hardware and software are fully open-source, supporting motion control and parameter adjustment through **RS485** or **I2C** buses. It also offers SWD and SWO debugging interfaces, providing developers with greater flexibility. This product is widely used in robotic joints, motion control, industrial automation, and visual demonstration projects.

### SKU: U188  U188-Lite

**RollerCAN Unit** is a brushless DC motor motion control kit with multiple integrated control functions, designed for efficient motion control. It supports 6-16V DC power input (via the CAN (XT30) interface) or 5V input (via the Grove interface) and can automatically adjust the power factor to ensure optimal performance. It features a built-in **FOC** closed-loop drive system, using a 3504 200KV brushless motor. The maximum continuous operating phase current is 0.5A without forced cooling, and 1A for short-term. The driver uses a magnetic encoder for feedback and supports current, speed, and position triple-loop control, ensuring precise control. The unit’s shaft can optionally include a **slip ring**, allowing the Grove interface on the top to remain connected with the bottom, supporting 360° rotation while expanding additional modules at the top. This ensures power and data transmission through the rotating part.

Additionally, the unit is equipped with a 0.66-inch OLED display on the back, which can display the device status in real-time. It also includes an RGB indicator and function button for easy human-machine interaction. The top and base are designed with LEGO-compatible mounting holes and M3 screw holes, making it easy to build and integrate quickly. RollerCAN Unit's hardware and software are fully open-source, supporting motion control and parameter adjustment via  **CAN** or **I2C** buses, and it also provides SWD and SWO debugging interfaces, offering developers greater flexibility. This product is widely used in machine joints, motion control, industrial automation, and visual demonstration projects.
