# Unit Roller Series

## Overview

### SKU: U182  U182-Lite

**Roller485 Unit** is an integrated brushless DC motor motion control kit designed for efficient motion control. It supports 6-16V DC power input (via PWR485 interface) or 5V input (via Grove interface) and can automatically adjust power coefficients to ensure optimal performance. It features a built-in **FOC** closed-loop drive system, utilizing a 3504 200KV brushless motor. Without forced cooling, it can operate with a maximum continuous phase current of 0.5A and a short-term current of 1A. The driver uses a magnetic encoder for feedback and supports current, speed, and position control, ensuring precise control.
Additionally, the device is equipped with a 0.66-inch **OLED** display on the back to display the device's status in real-time. It also includes an RGB indicator light and function button for easy human-computer interaction. The product's base is designed with LEGO-compatible mounting holes and M3 screw holes, making it easy to assemble and integrate. Roller485 Unitâ€™s hardware and software are fully open-source, supporting motion control and parameter adjustment through **RS485** or **I2C** buses. It also offers SWD and SWO debugging interfaces, providing developers with greater flexibility. This product is widely used in robotic joints, motion control, industrial automation, and visual demonstration projects.
